Question2 

radiographie : 

We notice that the contrast of the image is better, in deed the image has been calibrated 
(it doesn't necessarily give you a better image)

we see for example that for the chest that shades of gray became black and white became 
darker allowing better discernment of the elements present on the radiograph
on the other hand for the knee we can see clearly that increasing the contrast does 
not always make the image more readable


histogramme :

We notice that on the histogram of the unmodified images the data does not occupy all the x axis 
(representing the possible levels of gray that the pixels take) 
we notice that the histogram after the equalization has not changed its shape but better covers the whole gray spectrum



Question 3
The change in contrast is applied to the entire image and thus the noise, 
which can lead to a loss of useful information with an increase in noise

Question 4 

we can see that they are no change, in deed the image has already undergone the change to have a better gray scale
