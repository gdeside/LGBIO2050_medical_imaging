The T1 image comes directly from the scanner and as you know, MRI scanner acquire data in the frequency space, so you will need to reconstruct the image using the frequency data. Once you have both images, you will segment the lesion on both using the region growing method and compute the intersection in order to get a better contour of the lesion. \n",

Using equation (1), you can now compute the matrix $S(k_x,k_y)$ taking the proton density image as $ρ(x, y)$ to simulate a real patient in an MRI scanner.

    "The brain lesion can be seen on both images (left part of the brain, dark on the PD and bright on the T1). However, classification methods are not really suitable to segment it, as lesion intensities are similar in other parts of the brain. A simple segmentation method called ’region growing’ will be used in this case. The idea is to manually select a seed point (a pixel in the middle of the lesion) and to progressively expand it by taking the pixels which are similar to the segmented pixels according to some criterion. The criterion is usually based on the intensity of the considered pixel (if its intensity is in a small range around the mean intensity of the region, the pixel is added to the region). Additional criteria can be used (as gradient-based criteria, etc.), but these are optional for this challenge. Yet, uncertainties remain because of surrounding tissues of the same intensities. By segmenting the lesion on both images and by taking the intersection of both segmentation (because they were previously registered), you should be able to get a better estimation of the lesion contour.\n",

    "Implement a region growing method. You can use the sample picker cell here under to manually select the seeds. Remark: when using the region growing, pay attention not to evaluate a pixel more than one time, otherwise the algorithm will take too much time (for instance, you could store a map checked of 0 (not checked) and 1 (already checked) of the size of the image). An easy way to implement the growing is to use a variable-length vector (typicaly a list in python) containing all pixels that are to be checked. Each time that a pixel is added to the region, add the neighbors of this pixel to the variable-length vector so that these will be checked later. When the vector is empty, the algorithm stops.\n",
