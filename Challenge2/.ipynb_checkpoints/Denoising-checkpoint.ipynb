    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Like any other kind of images, medical imaging techniques are susceptible to noise and artifacts. Noise can be defined as a modification of the overall brightness of an image. Depending on the event at the origin of the noise (particle's physics, electronic device imprecision, patient motion, etc.), the perturbation can appear in various forms and noise removal techniques have to be adapted. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">In this challenge, we are interested in removing noise that follows a gaussian distribution. Such presence of noise makes the images unclear and may perplex the identification and analysis of diseases by a physician. Hence, denoising of medical images is a mandatory and essential pre-processing technique for further medical image processing stages.  <br><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">In this situation, $b_n$ is a continuous random variable. We speak about \"gaussian noise\" when the probability density function (PDF) of this random variable is a centered gaussian function. The PDF is given by: \n",
